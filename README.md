# Atlas 🦅

## Introduction

Atlas is one of the Hesiodic Titans of the founding myth of Greek mythology and ancient Greece, father of the Pleiades, Hyades, Hesperides and Calypso. Following his defeat in the Titans' war against the gods of Olympus and Zeus to rule the world, the latter condemned him to carry the world1 for eternity on his shoulders (described as one of the pillars of heaven in Homer’s Odyssey). It is petrified by Perseus with the head of Medusa and metamorphosed into the Atlas (massive) mountain range of North Africa.
